# TxtIDModel
Contributions: Anya Raghuvanshi and Haven Qin

This text identification model takes three different texts (.txt form) (a sample text and two comparisons) and shows the similarities two the comparisons by word count, length, stems, sentence lengths, and punctuation.

For example added onto this repo are txt files of huckleberry finn, the english translation of the communist manifesto, and one of the federalist papers. Using the model, we compared huckleberry finn to the manifesto and the federalist paper and found it had more similarities to the manifesto
