Using our TextID model, we evaluated two pieces of text - namely, Federalist Papers written by John Jay Adams
and The Communist Manifesto. After running our model a few times, we came to the conclusion that the Communist
Manifesto produces higher similarities to Huckleberry Finn than it does to Federalist Papers. Our team was not surprised by these results
the matched our expectations due to one primary reason. The Communist Manifesto was authoried in the year 1848 and Huckleberry Finn in
the year 1884, due to the similarity in time periods we expected higher similarities. Meanwhile, the federalist paper was written in the year
1787 thus making the use of different language styles and vocabulary.
